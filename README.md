__EXPERIMENTAL, DO NOT USE IN PRODUCTION YET__

## redux-socket-middleware

Middleware that dispatches [Redux](https://github.com/rackt/redux) actions to all connected clients.

### Usage

_Documentation on how to use this middleware will follow once a 0.1.0 release is available._

### TODO

* [ ] Write tests

__Nice to haves__

* [ ] Cleaner API to whitelist action types, eg whitelisting an entire namespace: `Acme/***` ect.
* [ ] "agnostic" package that works with web sockets instead of socket.io specifically.
